# 3 Tags Problem

3TP is a lightweight JavaScript library that extends HTML's native `<form>`, `<button>` and `<a>` capabilities by introducing `<x-form>`, `<x-button>` and `<x-a>` as web components. These components allow support for `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods, enable standalone buttons & anchors to perform AJAX actions, and support content replacement without breaking browser compatibility.

## Features

- Use `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods in forms.
- Allow standalone `<x-button>` elements to send requests without wrapping them in a form.
- Enable `<x-form>`, `<x-button>` and `<x-a>` to update DOM elements dynamically.
- No dependencies.

## Installation

Simply include the script in your project:

```html
<script src="3tp.js"></script>
```

# Usage

## Extended <x-form>

Works like a regular form but supports additional HTTP methods and dynamic content updates.

```html
<x-form action="/item" method="PUT" target="content">
  <input type="text" name="item" />
  <button type="submit">Update</button>
</x-form>
```

## Standalone button and anchor tags

Performs an AJAX request without requiring a form.

```html
<x-button action="/item" method="DELETE" target="content"> Delete </x-button>
```

```html
<x-a action="/item" method="PATCH" target="content"> Patch </x-a>
```

## Dynamic Content Replacement

All tags can update parts of the page dynamically using the target attribute.

```html
<div id="content"></div>

<x-button action="/load-content" method="GET" target="content">
  Load Content
</x-button>
```
